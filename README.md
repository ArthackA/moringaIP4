This project is a research to solve a range of Problems. The research was done by an electric Sharing company to determine
the most popular hour of returning cars in the city of Paris. The dataset is filled with a lot of missing values and irrelevant 
columns. 
A thorough cleaning of the dataset in done so as to compose it into a usable dataset. 
I have used pandas and numpy libraries to wrangle into the dataset and identify various issues with data and rectifying them
using python and pandas.
The above Notebook contain various actions i have performed in the dataset to help me understand and preparare the dataset
for analysis and evaluation.
